# Kaboom 
An unsual Minesweeper game. 

## About the Game
This is a cruel, but fair Minesweeper game in which you are to guess where the computer has places the mines. 
- The mines are not placed at the beginning, but determined as you play. Meaning there is no hidden state essentially.
- The computer will choose the worst scenario. 
- UNLESS, when you are forced to guess (there are no safe cells anywhere). Then, guessing is completely safe if you guess an adjacent square.
- Note: It is impossible to lose on the first click.

## Difficulties
You can decide to play this gamemode in 4 different preset difficulties.
### I'm too young to die
A 8 by 8 gamemode of kaboom, which only plays a mere total of 8 mines on the board. This allows for less thinking and a more fun user experience.  
### Hey not rough on me
A 10 by 10 gamemode of kaboom, which plays a total of 20 mines on the board. Definitley a tad harder than the previous gamemode 
### Hurt me plenty
A 15 by 15 gamemode of kaboom, which plays a total of 50 mines on the board. This difficulty requires a lot of thinking to fully sweep the mines.
### Ultra-Violence
A 10 by 10 gamemode of kaboom, which plays a total of 100 mines on the board. Not only is the amount of mines greater, the playing field has been made smaller. Good luck...
### Custom
If you want something different besides these preset gamemodes its possible to set, a different board size and different bomb amount. With the max playing 
field reaching 30 by 30. And the maximum amount of bombs being 99.

## Debuging
There is a debugging mode associated with the game that will show which tiles are safe to guess, and which are bombs by deduction. Additonally, the debug mode in kaboom 
will provide additional information such as, cached and uncached locations.

## Hints
There is a function linked to a hint button, which will output a brief hint to the player allowing for easier play to new users.
